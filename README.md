DEBIT_CREDIT.PY:

I'm looking to combine the 2 lists dr and cr, such that I'd end up having 1...12
printed in the first row of the Excel file Tests.xlsx. Subsequent rows would then
also occupy 12 cells across all the way to 120.

The output of [print(dr_cr)] in the console comes out as I'd want it. I'm however
having trouble joining the 2 adjacent lists together into 1.
